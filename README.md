**Abstract**:

The main motive of this device is to help the two-wheelers navigate without having to use different applications or mounting their mobile phones or other expensive machines on the vehicle. The significant finding from this project is the voice pack utilization for navigation. Our device can be used in bright sunlight as well as in the dark. It is compact and user-friendly. Our project has a benefit that we do not need any application for navigation. The Google APIs that are used to make a navigation system are costly; hence, we have made use of voice packs to make navigation device cheap. It could become an inbuilt function of Google Maps, and multiple devices could use it without needing to make separate applications for navigation.

**Working**:

The major breakthrough in this working is that we are using the google voice packs to get the navigation system data from google maps. All the command in google maps has a voice(.mp3) file linked with it which is played whenever the command is activated.We made a voice pack for our own having frequency linked with each command.The Bluetooth receiver receives the frequency and shows the linked command animation on the LED matrix.

**Design**:
* There is an additional hood to make the LED matrix visible in intense sunlight.
* The Garmin Quarter mount is easy to use and compatible with all types of cycle handlebars.
* The design has a slot at the front for a torch.
* The hood is sliding using a rolling pair behaving like a sliding pair. To lock the hood at the top position, we slide a small rectangular piece at the lower end of the hood into a small hole of similar dimensions made in the upper end of the body.
* The Quarter turn Garmin mount that we used for the mounting system has two components a plate and a mount.
* The plate rotates on the mount, after a quarter turn the plate locks on to the mount. It is one of the most efficient and easy to use mounting mechanism.

**Applications**:
* This device can be used for various vehicles and can be optimized to be used as an indicator for the direction when attached behind the cycle. 
* For the safety of expensive devices that we generally use for navigation 
* To avoid accidents that are caused due to earphones
